title: My Goals as developer
---

As a developer, I would love to be able to build my own web application, composed by a database as a backend, and a front end to launch on the web. In the past, I've always had good ideas, but I've never had a software developer buddy to help me building a company around it. Now, I'm 24 and I have a pretty stable career but I feel like this is the time for me to go all in, take the necessary risk to fulfill my dreams. 

I would love to merge my business and IT background to my passions and create a company that satisfies needs that people with my same passions have.

I'm a mountain lover, and I like to enjoy the mountain in very season. I would love to bring to more people the happiness and the restoration that spending time outside brings to me.

I see my developer experience as the beginning part of my enterpreneurial adventure!
