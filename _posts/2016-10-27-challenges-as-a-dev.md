title: Challenges learning Web Dev
---

Web Dev is challenging, especially because you need different skills to be good developer. I'm from Italy, and therefore, English is my second language, and learning how to code, is kind of learining a new language. You have to understand what a word means, you have to be able to put words together in sentences and finally you have to be able to give logical sense to your sentences. 

Now, I'm experiencing the same difficulties I faced while learning English, and this surpreised me at first because I thought it was all about logics.

Here below a list of the challenges that a newbie faces while learning how to code:

* LEARN NEW WAYS TO DO THINGS.

* BE READY TO GET FRUSTRATED AND SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON DETAILS.

* PRACTICE THE CODING LANGUAGE TAKES TIME.

* DELAY THE REWARD TO BUILD SOMETHING GREAT AFTER AGES OF STRUGGLE.

* LEARN HOW TO BREAK DOWN BIG PROBLEMS IN LITTLE SUB-PROBLEMS.

* TROUBLESHOOTING.

There are challenges for sure, but as I always say when I see a friend of mine stuggling, all the great things never happen easily, but after a lot of struggle.
