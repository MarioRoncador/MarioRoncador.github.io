title: My Experience at Bloc
---

So far, my experience at Bloc has been both hard and intriguing. The more I learn, the more I'm eager to learn more and when I end up building something on my own, I feel like the tools I'm learning are so powerful and will give me the chance to fulfill my dreams. However, it is really a challenge for me to be able to make time for Bloc, working full time as IT-Business consultant and traveling almost every week all over the country for work.

I can't deny I have to give up a lot of fun stuff I used to do before enrolling to this program: for example going biking, or visit new places during the weekend. But the more I go into this stuff, the more I feel that I'm building a set of skills that will be extremely useful both in my career and also toward my goal to start my own company.
