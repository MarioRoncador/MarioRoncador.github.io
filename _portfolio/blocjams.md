## Explanation

Bloc Jams is an on demand music player that works both on desktop and mobile devices. It connects songs stored on your device with a front end user interface made of multiple windows: Home page, album view and song view.

## Problem

The problem was to build from scratch a music player, as starting point to learn how to code. However, the bigger problem was to build a fully working application coming from no coding background, and knowing nothing but the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Solution

The solution was successfully reached, and also with the effort to make the code as efficient and easy as possible, trying to delete every redoundancy and everything that was not best practice.

## Results

The result is an 100% working application implemented in JavaScript. Every window is represented by an HTML document and every dynamic item on the page is accessed by JavaScript throgh the DOM. It was really interesting to see how almost everything can be moved and transformed using JavaScript instruction accessing HTML and CSS through the DOM selectors.

## Conclusion

Programming can be challenging but seen the result on real time and having the front-end browser showing the impact of every instruction on the application helps a lot. As a result, two birds with a stone: a fully working music player and some great JavaScript knowledge.
